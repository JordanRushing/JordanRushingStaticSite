      <p>My name is Jordan and I am a Software Engineer @ Amazon Web Services in Seattle, WA. I moved here in June of 2017 and it's been an incredible experience. Prior to Seattle I grew up in the DFW Metroplex and still visit often to see friends and family. When I'm not coding you will find me reading, listening to music, watching films and television shows, or lost in thought.</p>

      <p>The stack used to power this site is awesome and open-source so you should check out the code on my Github profile (linked above). My technical background is broad and includes formal computer science coursework, formal mathematics coursework, helpdesk experience, support engineering, systems engineering, and software engineering. I'm currently developing distributed Linux systems, network services, APIs, and command-line tools for the AWS Infrastructure DNS team.</p>
